    <p><b>Task Distribution</b></p>
    <p>This section should outline all the tasks that were performed and what percentage each team
      member contributed. If the balance is not evenly spread among all, the grades for each team
      member may differ. Each team member must submit the report.html, but with only the header,
      not the solution, and the Task Distribution section, affirming that you all agree on it.</p>
